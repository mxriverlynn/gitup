# Gitup: The Git Update Dance, Automated

Gitup is a small utility I built for my Rails apps, after growing tired of manually running the git update dance. Over time,
it's become a someone intelligent utility that has several options for configuration and runtime execution - including the
ability to change your settings based on what environment you're currently running in, what git branch you're on, etc.

An important note:

Gitup is not a general replacement for your git tools or knowledge. It only automated the git update dance that we do so
frequently, when we need to update our working branch from the main development branch.
